Delitter helps you capture, analyze and visualize litter you find in the environment and show the impact of your cleanups.

## Our mission
We believe that every small cleanup effort matters.
Our mission is to make the littering problem visible and measurable by supporting the reporting of local cleanup actions by groups like the boy scouts and mapping their impact.

## Quick overview
- Report litter by taking pictures.
- Get AI-powered image analysis that detects litter items, categories, materials, the brand and estimated weight.
- View collected reports on an interactive map and in a data dashboard.
- Sign up / sign in to save your cleanups and report about your impact.
