# Delitter â€” User Guide

Delitter helps you capture, analyze and visualize litter you find in the environment and show the impact of your cleanups.

## Our mission
We believe that every small cleanup effort matters.
Our mission is to make the littering problem visible and measurable by supporting the reporting of local cleanup actions by groups like the boy scouts and mapping their impact.
